"""
This program is trying to determine the total number of grades, average of all the grades, and the 
percent of grades that are scored higher than the average grade on the final exam.
There are 24 total scores on the final exam. The first function will display the total number of 
exams that were taken which is 24.
The next function will display the average score from all the exams. 
Lastly, the final function, which is grades above average, will output the percentage of grades that 
scored higher than average score from all the exams.
